# What is this project about ?
This simple project is an **interactive parallax wallpaper made for the app Lively Wallpaper**, but it should work for any live wallpaper app that uses html/css/javascript. It is a really basic parallax wallpaper of some album art.

# Can I modify it and use it, and if so, how ?
**Yes, this project is open source and you are free to modify it and share it to your heart's content.** It is really easy to set up a new parallax wallpaper with it, as you would only have to change the images in the layers folder to your own parallax layers, and it has some small but pretty powerful features that I go into more detail about in the project's documentation.

# Will this project receive updates and fixes in the future ?
This is a pretty small project, so **I can't promise that I'll keep on supporting it long term**, but I don't expect it to need much support either since it's pretty basic. I did however really enjoy making it, and look forward to using it in larger projects, such as an app that can generate a parallax wallpaper on its own when given an image, using this template.
